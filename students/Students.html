            <h1>What is <span class="text-red">Artificial <br> Intelligence</span>? </h1>
            <p class="info3">
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that enables computers to perform advanced functions
                typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception,
                language understanding, and decision-making. At its core, AI systems learn and improve through exposure
                to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and relationships that humans may miss.

                <h2>Why do we <span class="text-red">need</span> AI?</h2>
                <p class="info3">
                    <span class="text-red">What kind of problems does it solve?</span>
                    AI helps solve problems that are too big, too fast, too repetitive, or too complex for people to
                    handle alone. In short: AI is like an extra-smart helper that learns from data, spots patterns, and
                    automates work so humans can focus on creativity, judgment, and care.

                <h2>When & How did AI <span class="text-red">begin</span>?</h2>
                <p class="info3">
                    <span class="text-red">In 1950</span>, mathematician Alan Turing published a famous paper "Computing
                    Machinery and Intelligence" and posed the question: "Can machines think?"
                </p>
                <p class="info3">
                    He also proposed the Turing Test – a way to check if a machine can act so human-like that we can't
                    tell the difference.
